This repo describes how to use mimalloc with 1GiB hugepages when running Stellaris on Linux. The process was tested on Linux Mint 21.1 Cinnamon with 32GB of RAM. The process was described as "trivial" by this poster, yet I found it to be quite confusing and difficult. https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/high-level-wishlist-suggestions-to-improve-game-performance.1507394/
